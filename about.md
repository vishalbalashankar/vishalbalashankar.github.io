Greetings!!

<img align="right" class="center" src="/assets/IMG_6041.jpg" alt="" width="250">

Thank you for dropping by my blog. My name is Vishal. I am currently working as a Data-Wrangler at [Cybera](https://www.cybera.ca/), a not for profit organization, responsible for driving economic growth through digital technology in Alberta. 

I completed my Masterâ€™s in Chemical Engineering (thesis-based) in Jan. 2019 and worked for a year as a Research Associate at the Laboratory for Advanced Separation Processes ([LASP](https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/lasp/)) at the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alberta. During my graduate studies, I developed a simplified mathematical model for faster and efficient screening of adsorbents used in carbon capture applications. My Research Associate position allowed me to take the learnings from the grad school, and I worked closely with our industrial partner in designing and optimizing an air separation process. I developed machine learning-based computationally easier tools for predicting the pilot plant performance. 

With a background in engineering and my current work experience in data science, I am naturally fascinated towards engineering data-driven solutions to make human lives simpler, happier and healthier. Join me in my blog (which I am very excited about) to explore some of my learnings from my experiences in the field of engineering and data science. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any comments/questions.

Cheers,
 
Vishal
